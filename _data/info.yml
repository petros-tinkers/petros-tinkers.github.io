  This is where I document my projects. Explaining helps me learn
  (plus I love connecting with people). I work primarily on my own
  vehicles/projects. This lets me understand systems and experiment freely. As a
  Mechatronics tech I'm all about solving problems that don't have
  obvious answers, diving deep into issues instead of throwing parts at it. How I do it? By
  combining systematic diagnosis with custom solutions, often involving CAD/3D printing, as well as designing electronics to replace faulty factory
  components.
